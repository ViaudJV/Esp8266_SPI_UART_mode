# ESP8266_Transparent_SPI_UART_mode 

Version 0.1

## Overview

A simple Aplication for ESP8266 to make a Transparent mode for SPI and UART.

It is designed to send Data from a SPI bus to an UDP server and a TCP Server is used to Recieve or transmit slow command with control.

The ESP8266_Transparent_SPI_UART_mode is designed to provide maximum of the bandwith for emission of trace from a Robot


## Supported hardware

### ESP8266

The library is compatible with most of the ESP8266 modules & ESP8266 development boards.

### Serial

For Serial communications, the library has been tested with the direct USB serial connection on an USB communication and STM32DiscoveryF4

## Requirements

you will need the latest version of the Arduino IDE:

- [Arduino IDE 1.6.5](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)

### For WiFi using the ESP8266 chip

To use the library with the ESP8266 WiFi chip you will need to install the required module from the Boards Manager of the Arduino IDE. These are the steps to install the ESP8266 package inside the Arduino IDE:

1. Start the Arduino IDE and open the Preferences window
2. Enter `http://arduino.esp8266.com/package_esp8266com_index.json` into the Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
3. Open the Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install the esp8266 package (and after that don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu).
